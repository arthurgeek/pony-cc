# Pony Coding Challenges

This contains solutions to selected coding challenges from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/), implemented in the [Pony programming language](https://www.ponylang.io/).

I only plan to implement challenges that are a good fit for Pony. The goal is to learn Pony's unique features, such as its actor model, type system, and capabilities while solving interesting problems.

## Structure

Each challenge is organized in its own directory.

## How to Run

You'll need [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/) installed. To run a challenge:

```sh
cd <challenge-directory>
ponyc
./<challenge-directory>
